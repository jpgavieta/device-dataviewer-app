# Device Dataviewer

A portable Python dashboard to upload and view data, sourced from one or more devices. Deployed using Panel with a dark-mode aesthetic, featuring an interactive map and timeline graph.

Expandable ETL pipeline to add additional devices later (i.e. Atmotube, Raspberry Pi Sensors [PonyoPi], FitBit, Whatsapp, etc.) supported by notebook-based development to write and test device-tailored parsers before implementing into the ETL-to-Viz pipeline.

## How to use dashboard?

1. Create and activate conda env

Inside VSCode, Ctrl + Shift + ` to automatically open the terminal with this repo as the current directory

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate multidevice_dashboard 
```
Note: Works with either _mamba_ or _conda_ installer. If Linux user, _mamba_ is recommended. 


2. Run dashboard GUI with panel

```
panel serve app.py 
```

3. Choose device and variables to visualize

    Upload CSV (reads as bytes)
        ↓
    Select Device (applies parser)
        ↓
    Select Variables (filters columns)
        ↓ 
    *Optional: Clean Data (removes missing rows)

## How to use notebooks? 

Use to test-run any code chunks (functions) before implementing into the actual pipeline.
Uncomment the `.gitignore` to pretends notebook/ doesn't exist. 

ALWAYS create and activate conda env (`multidevice_dashboard`) before running any code.

### Writing new code

1. Upload any test data as raw CSV under `notebooks/sample_data`
2. Add a new notebook under `notebooks/`
3. Select Python interpreter for the notebook
    - Ctrl + Shift + P → type `Python: Select Interpreter` → `multidevice_dashboard`
4. Write and run code chunks using real data from `notebooks/sample_data`

Notes: Don't forget to `Clear Outputs` and `Restart` to clear the cache.

### Adding new parser

1. Add `src/parsers/yourdevice.py` with a `parse(df)` function
2. Import parser module and add to registry list in `src/etl.py`
3. Add its datasheet to `docs/`

Note: Uncomment the `.gitignore` to pretend the notebook doesn't exist.
